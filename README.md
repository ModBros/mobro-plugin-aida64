**Aida64 plugin for MoBro**

Integrate all AIDA64 metrics into [MoBro](https://mobro.app) through [AIDA64](https://www.aida64.com/)'s shared memory
functionality.

This plugin is developed and provided by ModBros and is not associated with AIDA64.  
It uses AIDA64's shared memory interface to transfer metrics to third-party applications.
